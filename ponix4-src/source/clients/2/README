On platforms that support CUPS (Common UNIX Printing System), a printer backend
(cups/vnc) is provided.  This should be installed into the CUPS backend
directory (typically /usr/lib/cups/backend, though this is dependent on the
local CUPS installation).  This file must be owned by root, and must be
executable only by root (octal permissions 0700).

In order to run VNC servers you will need a reasonably recent version of the X
window system installed.  This come as standard with most unix machines.  If
you don't have it installed, see http://www.xfree86.org or http://www.x.org

VNC Viewer for Java is provided in-built to VNC Server, but newer viewer
versions can be used if required by placing the files in a suitable directory,
e.g. /usr/local/vnc/classes and setting VNC Server's httpdir parameter.
By default, VNC Server's httpdir parameter will default to <inline>.

The default settings used by VNC applications can be modified by editing the 
system-wide defaults file at /etc/vnc/config.d/<app-name>, or the user's own 
overrides at $HOME/.vnc/config.d/<app-name>. Settings can also be overridden 
for a specific instance of an application by providing them on the 
command-line, e.g. 

 $ ./vncserver-x11 -RfbPort=5999

X server options for virtual-mode servers can be specified as system-wide
defaults in /etc/vnc/config, or the user's own overrides at $HOME/.vnc/config,
or on the command-line.

Installing from the tar file
============================

You should copy the programs to some directory which is in your PATH
environment variable, such as /usr/local/bin.  You can use the vncinstall
script to do this for you:

 $ ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin

This will also attempt to install the manual pages in an appropriate directory.
You can specify an alternative directory as a second argument to vncinstall:

 $ ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin /usr/local/man

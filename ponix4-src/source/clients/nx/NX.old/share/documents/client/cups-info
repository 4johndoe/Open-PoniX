 CUPS Printing Backend

 The NX Client set-up procedure detected that your "IPP CUPS" printing
 backend doesn't allow printing from the NX session. In order to have
 printing support in your NX system, you need to set proper permissions
 on the IPP backend. Please execute:

   chmod 755 /usr/lib/cups/backend/ipp

Wed Oct  7 20:58:07 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* imlib.m4: make it actually do the runtime test

Wed Sep 30 11:31:03 GMT 1998 Gary V. Vaughan <gvaughan@oranda.demon.co.uk>

	* configure.in: Check whether sysv ipc, shm and/or XShm are
	available (mostly taken from gtk+ configure.in).

	reran autoheader).

	* Imlib/Imlib_private.h, Imlib/Imlib_types.h,

Fri Sep  4 11:54:05 EDT 1998 Mandrake <mandrake@mandrake.net>

	* changed imlib-config.in to put -lXext before -lX11 so that
	systems which enforce link order will cease complaining
	(i.e. BSD/OS)

Thu Sep  3 13:08:12 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

Wed Aug 19 10:31:25 1998  Raph Levien  <raph@gtk.org>

	png "too old" test to make it correctly reject more versions.

1998-07-13  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* imlib-config.in (--libs): Reorder libraries.
	(--libs-gdk): Likewise.

1998-06-28  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* utils/imlib_config.c (read_imrc): Correctly handle the output of
	sscanf.  This was broken, broken, broken.  The code is still
	Raster-style though.  

1998-06-27  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in (AC_SUBST): Remove `config/imrc'.
	* config/Makefile.am (imrc): `sed' in sysconfdir.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add `imrc.in'.

	* gdk_imlib/misc.c: Likewise.
	* gdk_imlib/rend.c: Likewise.
	* gdk_imlib/gdk_imlib_private.h: Added byte and bit order fields
	to Xdata.
	* Imlib/Imlib_types.h: Likewise.

Tue Jun  9 01:13:26 PDT 1998 Manish Singh <yosh@gimp.org>

	* configure.in: Redid graphics lib checks, they are far
	more robust now.

1998-05-15  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* config/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add `im_palette.pal'.

Sun Apr 19 09:38:36 EDT 1998 Gregory McLean <gregm@comstar.net>

	* .cvsignore: updated to ignore generated files.

1998-04-03  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* configure.in: cruft.  please fix it for me!

Wed Mar 18 19:37:35 1998  Tom Tromey  <tromey@cygnus.com>

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Don't include utils.  This is done in
	configure.in.

Sun Mar 15 12:33:01 1998  Owen Taylor <owt1@cornell.edu>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Include GTK_CFLAGS, not X_CFLAGS.
	(LDADD): Include GTK_LIBS, not explicit gtk/X libraries.

	* configure.in: Use AM_PATH_GTK to find gtk.  Don't use
	AC_CHECK_LIB.

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Conditionally build in gdk_imlib.

1998-02-26  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* general: removed all the old Makefile.in files, since raster has
	now endorsed the automakification.

1998-02-24  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@cs.umn.edu>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Also include $(X_CFLAGS).
	(LDADD): Use `libtool', and also link in all those `gtk+' stuff.
	Should probably autoconf this stuff a bit more.

1998-02-24  Federico Mena Quintero  <federico@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* utils/Makefile.am (INCLUDES): Added INCLUDES so that it can find
	the gdk_imlib headers.  I hope this is the right way to do it.

1998-02-24  Mark Galassi  <rosalia@cygnus.com>

	* configure.in: added AM_PROG_LIBTOOL so we can generate shared
	libraries.

	* Makefile.am, configure.in: put imlib under automake/autoconf.

	* *: Fix spelling mistakes.

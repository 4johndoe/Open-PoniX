Since installation methods may vary based on your Linux distribution, these
instructions are minimal and assume you understand how to compile a Linux
kernel.

Read the ReleaseNotes.txt file first for code name definitions and caveats.



!!! Attention package maintainers !!!

Include the applicable license contained in the LICENSE file in all packages
derived from the cedarview-userspace and cedarview-vaapi tarballs. The kernel
source patch is licensed under the GPLv2. The libwsbm upstream project has a
MIT license.



== Kernel ==

* Apply this kernel patch to avoid a known video playback issue:
    * kernel-ttm-clear-high.patch

* Apply the kernel driver patch for your desired target:
    * For "Ant": cedarview-kernel-v1.0.1_ant.patch
    * For "Bee": cedarview-kernel-v1.0.1_bee.patch

* Add the following line to drivers/staging/Kconfig:
  source "drivers/staging/cdv/Kconfig"

* Add the following line to drivers/staging/Makefile:
  obj-$(CONFIG_DRM_INTEL_CDV) += cdv/

  To enable the Cedarview kernel driver component, be sure to set the following
  kernel config variables:

   CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G=y
   # CONFIG_DRM_PSB is not set  
   CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI=y  
   CONFIG_DRM_INTEL_CDV=y  
   CONFIG_DRM_CDV_RELEASE=y  
   # CONFIG_DRM_CDV_DEBUG is not set  
   # CONFIG_DRM_PVR_PDUMP is not set

* Compile the kernel and install



== Userspace Components ==

* Unpack and install cedarview-libwsbm binary tarball relative to your root
  filesystem:
    * cedarview-libwsbm-1.1.0.tar
    * If you need to build from source (provided in src/), consult the MeeGo
      build profile:
        * http://build.meego.com/package/files?package=libwsbm-cdv&project=MeeGo%3A1.2.0%3ACedarTrail%3Aoss

* Install libva and dependencies from your package manager.
    * See ReleaseNotes.txt for supported versions

* Unpack and install the appropriate userspace (Xorg, 2D, 3D) Cedarview drivers
  relative to your root filesystem. While the PowerVR driver is a Mesa
  replacement for EGL and GL ES, mesa-libGL of the stated version is required for
  OpenGL operation. Note that development headers are installed as well.
    * For "Ant": cedarview-userspace-v1.0.1_ant.tar.bz2
    * For "Bee": cedarview-userspace-v1.0.1_bee.tar.bz2

* Unpack the PVR VA-API driver for Cedartrail-accelerated H.264, MPEG-2, and
  VC1 streams:
    * For "Ant": cedarview-vaapi-v1.0.1_ant.tar
    * For "Bee": cedarview-vaapi-v1.0.1_bee.tar

* Reboot your system into the new kernel. Starting X will initialize the PVR
  driver.

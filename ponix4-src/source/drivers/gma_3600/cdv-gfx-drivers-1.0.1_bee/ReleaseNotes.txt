= IntelÂ® Linux PowerVR !Graphics/Media Drivers for CedarTrail =



== Version 1.0.1 Product Release ==

June 7, 2012 (WW23)

 * This is an ''internal release'' only. Should this package be exposed
   externally, the exposing entity would need to ensure all proper procedures
   have been followed and legal obligations met.
 * The most recent formal release was **version 1.0**.

This is a scheduled **version 1.0.1** cumulative bugfix release for the Linux
accelerated graphics/media driver on the CedarTrail platform, with the addition
of Display Port (eDP and DP) support for certain CedarTrail SKUs. Contact your
Intel(R) support representative for more details.

These graphics/media drivers are ported from Imagination Technologies (IMG)
Device Driver Kit (DDK) version 1.7 ED862890.

The quality assessment report for this release can be obtained by contacting
your Intel(R) support representative.

A comprehensive list of all fixed bugs can be obtained from your Intel(R)
support representative.



=== Known Issues ===

 * When a system has >= 4 GiB RAM and is running a PAE-enabled kernel, the
   display is non-functional (#295)
  * Work-around: Distribute kernel with CONFIG_HIGHMEM4G enabled or pass the
    `mem=4G` kernel cmdline argument at boot-time
 * There is no 64-bit support in the driver
 * Up to two display heads (LVDS/eDP plus an external display) are supported
 * Minimal X Video Extension (Xv) support is provided for legacy applications
   but is not formally supported
 * Very limited support for OpenGL API ("big GL"). (#101 #107 #230)
 * Poor 2D rendering performance through Xlib protocol. (#9 #125 #126)
 * H.264 media playback on external displays can show increased artifacts,
   frame dropping, flickering, and jerky playback. (#143 #149)
 * Tearing artifacts when using Xv to play back non-accelerated video at
   full-screen.(#231)
 * Certain HTML5/WebGL demos exhibit artifacts and poor performance. (#123 #128
   #172 #181)

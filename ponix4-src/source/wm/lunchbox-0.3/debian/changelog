lunchbox (0.3-2) unstable; urgency=low
  * Corrected memory leaks in "create_frame_name" but also removed some optimizations.
  * changed int variables to Bools where appropriate.
  * Removed virtual desktops to reduce flicker.  
  * Corrected realloc of workspaces to update invalidated pointers. 
  * Got remove_frame to reset states to protect preconditions elsewhere.
  * Removed a defect causing windows to not be available in other workspaces if they were mapped into the current workspace.
  * Improved fullscreen mode to allow windows to be created in fullscreen mode (e.g., firefox flash videos require this).
  * Fixed a bug in resize_tiling_frame which was causing it to fail.
  * Added desktop file to /usr/share/xsessions/ for gdm
  * Corrected defects not allowing the window manager to run with no windows open.

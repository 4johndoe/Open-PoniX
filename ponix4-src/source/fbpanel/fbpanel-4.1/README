NAME
        fbpanel is a lightweight GTK2-based panel for UNIX desktop

SYNOPSYS
        fbpanel [OPTION]...

DESCRIPTION
        fbpanel is desktop panel which provides graphical information and feedback about 
        desktop activity and allows interaction with the window manager. 
        It features:
         o taskbar    - show list of the managed windows (tasks)
         o pager      - thumbnailed view of the desktop
         o launchbar  - buttons to quickly launch applications
         o show desktop - button to iconify or shade all windows 
         o image      - display an image
         o clock      - show the current time and/or date
         o sytem tray - tray for XEMBED icons (aka docklets)
         o space      - just seize space

        fbpanel requires NETWM (www.freedesktop.org) compliant window manager. 

        You can run many instances of fbpanel each with its own configuration
        (see OPTIONS below).

        Most updated info about fbpanel can be found on its home page:
                http://fbpanel.sf.net/

OPTIONS
        -h        - prints help message and exits
        -v        - prints version and exits
        -p <name> - use specified profile. The profile will be taken from file
                    ~/.fbpanel/<name>. If that fails, then /usr/share/fbpanel/<name>
                    will be used. No '-p' option is equivalent to '-p default'.
                    
CUSTOMIZATION
        To change default settings, copy profile file to your home directory
                mkdir -p ~/.fbpanel
                cp /usr/share/fbpanel/default ~/.fbpanel
        and edit it. Default profile file contains comments and explanation inside,
        so it should be easy. For full list of options please visit fbpanel's home page

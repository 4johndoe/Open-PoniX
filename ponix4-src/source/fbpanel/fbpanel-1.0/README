This is README file for 'fbpanel' project. 

1. General

fbpanel is a light-weight X11 desktop panel. It provides taskbar (list of all opened
windows), desktop switcher, launchbar, clock and more...

Requirements:
    * EWMH/NETWM compliant window manager (eg sawfish, openbox, enlightment, kvm)
    * GTK-1.2 and gdk_pixbuf 

Home Page:
    http://fbpanel.sf.net/


2. Install
   % make
   % cp fbpanel ~/bin          # or somewhere else in your PATH
   % mkdir -p ~/.fbpanel       # create config directory
   % cp config/*  ~/.fbpanel/  # copy sample config files and EDIT them!
  

3. Configuration
* launcbar
    o adding buttons
      To add, say, 'Galeon' button add these lines to ~/.fbpanel/launchbar:
      [
      Image::/home/me/icons/Galeon-Web.png
      #Tooltip can be omitted or left empty
      Tooltip::galeon - the web, only the web
      Action::galeon&
      ]

* taskbar
    o changing default icon
      Add this lines at the top of ~/.fbpanel/taskbar

      [
      Image::/home/me/icons/Default.png
      ]

    o setting custom icons
      You can configure taskbar to use custom icon for windows that do not provide
      their own. This is how to
       + identify window's class strings
         Run xprop, click on a window and look for WM_CLASS in the xprop's output.
         For example, for emacs you will see

         WM_CLASS(STRING) = "emacs", "Emacs"

         First string ("emacs") is called AppName, and second ("Emacs") - ClassName.
       + Add these lines to ~/.fbpanel/taskbar
         [
         Image::/home/me/icons/Emacs.png
         AppName::emacs
         ClassName::Emacs
         ]


* clock
    clock's configuration file is ~/.fbpanel/clock. For details on clock and tooltip
    format see strftime's manpage (man strftime).
    o clock format
      # Time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M)
      Clock::%R

    o tooltip format
      # Weekday name + date
      Tooltip::%A %x

    o action
      # shell command to run upon mouse click.
      Action::ical &

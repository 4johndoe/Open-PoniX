- when the sound driver supports only a single recording source, aumix may use
  an incorrect ioctl (Debian bug 116396, reported by Antonio Arauzo--see
  <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=116396>--unconfirmed)
- when using the GTK+ interface, if no sound driver is loaded, no error message
  is printed (Debian bug 170370, reported by Jan Minaarz--see
  <URL:http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=170370>--confirmed by
  Trevor Johnson)
- suspending with ^Z may make the terminal difficult to use
- when updating ncurses screen periodically, record and play controls are
  redrawn even if their settings haven't changed 
- most translations need to be updated
- on the PC, program exits from ncurses mode when it receives strange keyboard
  input such as Alt- combinations
- ncurses display is not correct on very narrow terminals (22 columns or fewer)
- in an xterm, screen may not always be redrawn properly when it is resized
- some options only work when given in a particular order
- "-f -" does not load settings from stdin
- balance controls can get stuck when adjusted from the keyboard
- Christian Weisgerber reports "aumix dies with malloc() complaining about a
  recursive call"
- configure --help doesn't mention --without-gpm or --without-sysmouse
- Greg Louis reports problems with "make install" on Linux with libc5 when GNU
  gettext is not installed:
   /bin/sh: --default-domain=aumix: command not found
   make[1]: *** [aumix.pot] Error 127
   make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/aumix-2.1/po'
   make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
  This error also appears on FreeBSD with gettext installed, when building
  with --disable-nls and no patches applied (not using the port).
- GNU make is still needed for "clean" and "distclean" targets, and for
  generating po/aumix.pot
- generation of intl/po2tbl.sed (which generates po/cat-id-tbl.c) is broken

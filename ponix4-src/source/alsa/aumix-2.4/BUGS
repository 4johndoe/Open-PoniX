- suspending with ^Z may make the terminal difficult to use
- when updating screen periodically, record and play controls are redrawn
  even if their settings haven't changed 
- most translations need to be updated
- on the PC, program exits from ncurses mode when it receives strange keyboard
  input such as Alt- combinations
- display is not correct on very narrow terminals (22 columns or fewer)
- German menu is too wide:  can we adjust XOFFSET automagically for different
  languages, or not display the menu if there is no room for it?
- in an xterm, screen may not always be redrawn properly when it is resized
- some options only work when given in a particular order
- "-f -" does not load settings from stdin
- balance controls can get stuck when adjusted from the keyboard
- Christian Weisgerber reports "aumix dies with malloc() complaining about a
  recursive call"
- in ncurses screen with --enable-own-labels, labels are too wide in Russian
- configure --help doesn't mention --without-gpm or --without-sysmouse
- in GTK+ screen, level adjustments have different widths for mono and stereo
  channels
- Greg Louis reports problems with "make install" on Linux with libc5 when GNU
  gettext is not installed:
   /bin/sh: --default-domain=aumix: command not found
   make[1]: *** [aumix.pot] Error 127
   make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/aumix-2.1/po'
   make: *** [install-recursive] Error 1
  This error also appears on FreeBSD with gettext installed, when building
  with --disable-nls and no patches applied (not using the port).
- when building with rpm, configure script is run twice with different options
- accelerator keys for GTK+ menus aren't translated

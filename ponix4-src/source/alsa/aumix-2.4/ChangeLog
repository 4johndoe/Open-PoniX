  volume, bass, and treble (layout idea borrowed from CAM), so
  labels don't have to be jammed together

- moved printf statements after the ioctl call, since this makes more
  sense if the ioctl fails (K.H.)

  processes system-wide will be properly reflected (T.J.)

  disabled entirely (T.J.)

1996-12-06 - version 1.5

- changed meaning of "<" and ">" keys (now same as Tab or Enter)
- "," and "." function synonymously with "<" and ">" so users need not shift
  when using US keyboard

  changes to the sound driver

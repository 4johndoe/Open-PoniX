<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 Authors</A>
</H2>

<P>The authors of GTK+ are:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Peter Mattis    (petm@xcf.berkeley.edu)</LI>
<LI>Spencer Kimball (spencer@xcf.berkeley.edu)</LI>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 What is GTK+?</A>
</H2>

<P>GTK+ is a small and efficient widget set designed with the general look 
and feel of Motif.  In reality, it looks much better than Motif.  It
contains common widgets and some more complex widgets such as a file
selection, and color selection widgets.
<P>GTK+ provides some unique features. (At least, I know of no other widget 
library which provides them). For
example, a button does not contain a label, it contains a child widget, 
which in most instances will be a label.
However, the child widget can also be a pixmap, image or any combination 
possible the programmer desires.
This flexibility is adhered to throughout the library. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.3">1.3 What is the + in GTK+?</A>
</H2>

<P>Peter Mattis informed the gtk mailing list that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I originally wrote gtk which included the three libraries, libglib,
libgdk and libgtk. It featured a flat widget hierarchy. That is, you
couldn't derive a new widget from an existing one. And it contained
a more standard callback mechanism instead of the signal mechanism now
present in gtk+. The + was added to distinguish between the original
version of gtk and the new version. You can think of it as being an
enhancement to the original gtk that adds object oriented features."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.4">1.4 Does the G in GTK+ stand for General, Gimp, or GNU?</A>
</H2>

<P>Peter Mattis informed the gtk mailing list that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I think the last time Spencer and I talked about it we decided on 
GTK = Gimp ToolKit. But I don't know for sure. Its definately not
GNU, though."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.5">1.5 Where is the documentation for GTK+?</A>
</H2>

<P>In the GTK+ distribution's doc/ directory you will find the
reference material for both GTK and GDK, this FAQ and the
GTK Tutorial.
<P>In addition, you can find links to HTML versions of these documents 
by going to 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</A>.
<P>The Tutorial and FAQ can also be found at
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/4299/">http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Lab/4299/</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.6">1.6 Is there a mailing list (or mailing list archive) for GTK+?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two mailing lists:
<UL>
<LI>A mailing list for discussion of development of GTK based applications
is hosted at gtk-app-devel-list@redhat.com. To subscribe send an
email message to 
<A HREF="mailto:gtk-app-devel-list-request@redhat.com">gtk-app-devel-list-request@redhat.com</A>
with <EM>subscribe</EM> in the <B>subject</B>.
<P>
</LI>
<LI>A mailing list for discussion of development of GTK is hosted 
at gtk-list@redhat.com. To subscribe send an
email message to 
<A HREF="mailto:gtk-list-request@redhat.com">gtk-list-request@redhat.com</A>
with <EM>subscribe</EM> in the <B>subject</B>.
<P>A searchable archive of the mailing list can be found at

</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.7">1.7 The gtk-list hasn't had any traffic for days, is it dead?</A>
</H2>

<P>No, everyone's just busy coding.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.8">1.8 How to get help with GTK+</A>
</H2>

<P>First, make sure your question isn't answered in the documentation, this
FAQ or the tutorial. Done that? You're sure you've done that, right? In
that case, the best place to post questions is to the GTK+ mailing list.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss1.9">1.9 How to report bugs in GTK+</A>
</H2>

<P>Bug reports should be sent to the GTK+ mailing list.
<P>

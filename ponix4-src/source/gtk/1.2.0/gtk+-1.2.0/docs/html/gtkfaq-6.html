<H2><A NAME="s6">6. About glib</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 What is glib?</A>
</H2>

<P>glib is a library of useful functions and definitions available for use 
when creating GDK and GTK applications. It provides replacements for some
standard libc functions, such as malloc, which are buggy on some systems.
<P>It also provides routines for handling:

<LI>Doubly Linked Lists</LI>
<LI>Singly Linked Lists</LI>
<LI>Timers</LI>
<LI>String Handling</LI>
<LI>A Lexical Scanner</LI>
<LI>Error Functions</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss6.2">6.2 Why use g_print, g_malloc, g_strdup and fellow glib functions ? </A>
</H2>

<P>Thanks to Tim Janik who wrote to gtk-list: (slightly modified)
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regarding g_malloc(), g_free() and siblings, these functions are much safer
than thier libc equivalences.  For example, g_free() just returns if called 
with NULL.  Also, if USE_DMALLOC is defined, the definition for these 
functions changes (in glib.h) to use MALLOC(), FREE() etc...  If MEM_PROFILE
or MEM_CHECK are defined, there are even small statistics made counting
the used block sizes (shown by g_mem_profile() / g_mem_check()).
<P>Considering the fact that glib provides an interface for memory chunks
to save space if you have lots of blocks that are always the same size
and to mark them ALLOC_ONLY if needed, it is just straight forward to
create a small saver (debug able) wrapper around the normal malloc/free
stuff as well - just like gdk covers Xlib. ;)
<P>Using g_error() and g_warning() inside of applications like the GIMP
that fully rely on gtk even gives the opportunity to pop up a window
showing the messages inside of a gtk window with your own handler
(by using g_set_error_handler()) along the lines of gtk_print()
(inside of gtkmain.c).

<H2><A NAME="ss4.1">4.1 How do I get started?</A>
</H2>

<P>So, after you have installed GTK+ there are a couple of things that can
ease you into developing applications with it. There is the
GTK+ Tutorial 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/">&lt;http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/&gt;</A>, which is undergoing 
development. This will introduce you to writing applications using C.
<P>The Tutorial doesn't (yet) contain information on all of the widgets
that are in GTK+. For example code on how to use the basics of all the
GTK+ widgets you should look at the file gtk/testgtk.c (and associated
source files) within the GTK+ distribution. Looking at these exmaples will
give you a good grounding on what the widgets can do.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.2">4.2 What widgets are in GTK?</A>

<H2><A NAME="ss4.3">4.3 Is GTK+ thread safe? How do I write multi-threaded GTK+ applications?</A>
</H2>

<P>Although GTK+, like many X toolkits, isn't thread safe, this does
not prohibit the development of multi-threaded applications with
GTK+. 
<P>Rob Browning (rlb@cs.utexas.edu) describes threading techniques for
use with GTK+ (slightly edited): 
<P>There are basically two main approaches, the first is simple, and the
second complicated. In the first, you just make sure that all GTK+ (or
X) interactions are handled by one, and
only one, thread. Any other thread that wants to draw something has
to somehow notify the "GTK+" thread, and let it handle the
actual work. 
<P>The second approach allows you to call GTK+ (or X) functions from any
thread, but it requires some careful synchronization. The
basic idea is that you create an X protection mutex, and no one may
make any X calls without first acquiring this mutex. 
<P>Note that this is a little effort, but it allows you to be
potentially more efficient than a completely thread safe GTK+. You
get to decide the granularity of the thread locking. You also have to
make sure that the thread that calls gtk_main is holding the lock when
it calls gtk_main.
<P>The next thing to worry about is that since you were holding the
global mutex when you entered gtk_main, all callbacks will also be
holding it. This means that the callback must release it if it's
going to call any other code that might reacquire it. Otherwise
you'll get deadlock. Also, you must be holding the mutex when you
finally return from the callback. 
<P>In order to allow threads other than the one calling gtk_main to
get access to the mutex, we also need to register a work function
with GTK that allows us to release the mutex periodically.
<P>Why can't GTK+ be thread safe by default?                           
<P>Complexity, overhead, and manpower.  The proportion of threaded
programs is still reasonably small, and getting thread safety right is
both quite difficult and takes valuable time away from the main work
of getting a good graphics library finished.  It would be nice to have
GTK+ thread safe "out of the box", but that's not practical right now,
and it also might make GTK+ substantially less efficient if not handled
carefully.
<P>Regardless, it's especially not a priority since relatively good
workarounds exist.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.4">4.4 How can I prevent redrawing and resizing while I change multiple widgets?</A>
</H2>

<P> 
Use gtk_container_disable_resize and gtk_container_enable_resize around the 
code where you are changing a lot of stuff. This will result in much faster 
speed since it will prevent resizing of the entire widget hierarchy. 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.5">4.5 How do I catch a double click event (in a list widget, for example)?</A>
</H2>

<P>Tim Janik wrote to gtk-list (slightly modified):
<P>Define a signal handler:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
gint
signal_handler_event(GtkWiget *widget, GdkEvenButton *event, gpointer func_data)
{
  if (GTK_IS_LIST_ITEM(widget) &amp;&amp;

        event->type==GDK_3BUTTON_PRESS) ) {
    printf("I feel %s clicked on button %d\",

<P>Note that a single button press will be received beforehand, and
if you are doing this for a button, you will therefore also get a
"clicked" signal for the button. (This is going to be true for
any toolkit, since computers aren't good at reading one's
mind.)

<H2><A NAME="ss4.6">4.6 How do I find out about the selection of a GtkList?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>Get the selection something like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
GList *sel;
sel = GTK_LIST(list)->selection;
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>This is how GList is defined (quoting glist.h):
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
typedef struct _GList GList;

struct _GList
{
  gpointer data;
  GList *next;
  GList *prev;
};
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A GList structure is just a simple structure for doubly linked lists.
there exist several g_list_*() functions to modify a linked list in
glib.h.  However the GTK_LIST(MyGtkList)->selection is maintained
by the gtk_list_*() functions and should not be modified.
<P>The selection_mode of the GtkList determines the selection
facilities of a GtkList and therefore the contents
of GTK_LIST(AnyGtkList)->selection:
<P>
<PRE>
selection_mode          GTK_LIST()->selection contents
------------------------------------------------------

GTK_SELECTION_SINGLE)   selection is either NULL
                        or contains a GList* pointer
                        for a single selected item.

GTK_SELECTION_BROWSE)   selection is NULL if the list
                        contains no widgets, otherwise
                        it contains a GList* pointer
                        for one GList structure.
GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE) selection is NULL if no listitems
                        are selected or a a GList* pointer
                        for the first selected item. that
                        in turn points to a GList structure
                        for the second selected item and so
                        on

GTK_SELECTION_EXTENDED) selection is NULL.
</PRE>
<P>The data field of the GList structure GTK_LIST(MyGtkList)->selection points
to the first GtkListItem that is selected.  So if you would like to determine 
which listitems are selected you should go like this:
<P>Upon Initialization:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

        gchar           *list_items[]={

                                "foo",
                                "last Item",
                        };
        guint           nlist_items=sizeof(list_items)/sizeof(list_items[0]);
        GtkWidget       *list_item;
        guint           i;

        list=gtk_list_new();
        gtk_list_set_selection_mode(GTK_LIST(list), GTK_SELECTION_MULTIPLE);
        gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(AnyGtkContainer), list);
        gtk_widget_show (list);

        for (i = 0; i &lt; nlist_items; i++)
        {
                list_item=gtk_list_item_new_with_label(list_items[i]);
                gtk_object_set_user_data(GTK_OBJECT(list_item), (gpointer)i);
                gtk_container_add(GTK_CONTAINER(list), list_item);
                gtk_widget_show(list_item);
        }
}
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To get known about the selection:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
{
        GList   *items;

        items=GTK_LIST(list)->selection;

        printf("Selected Items: ");
        while (items) {

<H2><A NAME="ss4.7">4.7 Is it possible to get some text displayed which is truncated to fit inside its allocation? </A>
</H2>

<P>GTK's behavior (no clipping) is a consequence of its attempts to
conserve X resources. Label widgets (among others) don't get their own
X window - they just draw their contents on their parent's window.
While it might be possible to have clipping occur by setting the clip
mask before drawing the text, this would probably cause a substantial
performance penalty.
<P>Its possible that, in the long term, the best solution to such
problems might be just to change gtk to give labels X windows.
A short term workaround is to put the label widget inside another
widget that does get it's own window - one possible candidate would
be the viewport widget.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
viewport = gtk_viewport (NULL, NULL);
gtk_widget_set_usize (viewport, 50, 25);
gtk_viewport_set_shadow_type (GTK_VIEWPORT(viewport), GTK_SHADOW_NONE);
gtk_widget_show(viewport);

label = gtk_label ("a really long label that won't fit");
gtk_container_add (GTK_CONTAINER(viewport), label);
gtk_widget_show (label);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If you were doing this for a bunch of widgets, you might want to
copy gtkviewport.c and strip out the adjustment and shadow
functionality (perhaps you could call it GtkClipper).

<H2><A NAME="ss4.8">4.8 Why don't the contents of a button move when the button is pressed? Here's a patch to make it work that way...</A>
</H2>

<P>From: Peter Mattis
<P>The reason buttons don't move their child down and to the right when
they are depressed is because I don't think that's what is happening
visually. My view of buttons is that you are looking at them straight
on. That is, the user interface lies in a plane and you're above it
looking straight at it. When a button gets pressed it moves directly
away from you. To be absolutely correct I guess the child should
actually shrink a tiny amount. But I don't see why the child should
shift down and to the left. Remember, the child is supposed to be
attached to the buttons surface. Its not good for it to appear like
the child is slipping on the surface of the button.
<P>On a more practical note, I did implement this at one point and
determined it didn't look good and removed it.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.9">4.9 How can I define a separation line in a menu? </A>
</H2>

<P>See the 
<A HREF="http://www.gtk.org/tutorial/">Tutorial</A> for information on how to create menus.
However, to create a separation line in a menu, just insert an
empty menu item:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
menuitem = gtk_menu_item_new();
gtk_menu_append(GTK_MENU(menu), menuitem);
gtk_widget_show(menuitem);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.10">4.10 How can I right justify a menu, such as Help, when using the MenuFactory? </A>
</H2>

<P>Use something like the following:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
menu_path = gtk_menu_factory_find (factory,  "&lt;MyApp>/Help");
gtk_menu_item_right_justify(menu_path->widget);
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.11">4.11 How do I make my window modal? / How do I make a single window active?</A>
</H2>

<P>After you create your window, do gtk_grab_add(my_window). And after 
closing the window do gtk_grab_remove(my_window).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss4.12">4.12 Why doesn't my widget (e.g. progressbar) update?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>You are probably doing all the changes within a function 
without returning control to gtk_main. Most drawing updates are only 
placed on a queue, which is processed within gtk_main. You can
force the drawing queue to be processed using something like:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
while (gtk_events_pending())
        gtk_main_iteration();
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>inside you're function that changes the widget.
<P>What the above snippet does is run all pending events and high priority 
idle functions, then return immediately (the drawing is done in a 
high priority idle function).

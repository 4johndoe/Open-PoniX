# Open-PoniX

# This project represents years of improving thinstation 2.2 and adjusting it to comply
# with the modern hardware.
#
# This projects consists of two parts: constructor and sources.
#
# In order to introduce minor changes (such as include/exclude different packages or try out
# different RDP clients) and build your own ponix you can use the constructor part.
#
# Things get messy when you need to update drivers or kernel modules/settings. For that
# you will need the source part.
# This will require you to run ./RUNME file to enter toolchain environment, compile all
# neccessary modules or files and transfer them to the constructor
#
